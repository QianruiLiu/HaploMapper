# Geography Visualization (Version 1)

## Overview
The initial version of the frequency-table generating script (`haplogroup_frequency_tables.py`) didn't do with the subclades. Only frequencies of basal haplogroup were calculated.
This initial version of the geography visualization script (`geography.py`) provides a basic map presentation of haplogroup distributions. It displays only the main haplogroups without analyzing or visualizing any subtypes.
