# Geography Visualization (Version 2)

## Overview
The new version of haplogroup_frequency_tables.py (`new_haplogroup_frequency_tables.py`) can calculate subclades frequencies.
This second version (`newgeography.py`) builds upon the initial visualization by integrating subtype analysis. It attempts to display both main haplogroups and their subtypes concurrently.

## Known Issues
- **Alignment Problem:** The outer ring (subtypes) does not align correctly with the inner ring (main haplogroups). This misalignment might lead to inaccurate visual interpretation.
- **Limitation of interaction:** Users can only choose whether Y-chr or mtDNA to visualize, no other filtering options.
