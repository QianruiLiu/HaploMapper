# Geography Visualization (Version 3)

## Overview
The third iteration, `lately_geography.py`, introduces further refinements aimed at addressing the alignment issues from Version 2. This version attempts to better synchronize the display of subtypes with their corresponding main haplogroups.

## Features
- **Improved Alignment:** Efforts have been made to better align the outer ring (subtypes) with the inner ring (main haplogroups).

## Limitations
- **Remaining Alignment Challenges:** When a main haplogroup lacks corresponding subtype data, alignment may still suffer.
- **considering adding Some further interaction:** Some kinds of interaction like allowing users to filter samples by ages is waiting to be developed.
